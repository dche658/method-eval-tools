# Method Evaluation Tools Excel Add-in

The purpose of this add-in is to provide some statistical procedures that are
necessary for verifying for validating clinical laboratory methods but are not easy to implement
using builtin Excel spreadsheet functions. It is not meant to be a comprehensive
statistical analysis tool. The current interation allows the user to perform
linear regression techniques including Passing-Bablok, Deming, and Weighted Deming.

Procedures are also provide to allow users to analyse variance components as
described in CLSI EP15 and EP05.

This tools has been designed for use by laboratory professionals in association
with the accompanying
[method verification workbook](https://metools.chesher.id.au/assets/mvw.xlsx).

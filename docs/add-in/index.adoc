The purpose of this add-in is to provide some statistical procedures that are
necessary for verifying or validating clinical laboratory methods but are not easy to implement
using builtin Excel spreadsheet functions. It is not meant to be a comprehensive
statistical analysis tool. The current interation allows the user to perform
linear regression techniques including Passing-Bablok, Deming, and Weighted Deming.

Procedures are also provided to allow users to analyse variance components 
as described in CLSI EP15 and EP05.

This tools has been designed for use by laboratory professionals in association
with the accompanying https://metools.chesher.id.au/assets/mvw.xlsx[method verification workbook].

== Using the Add-in

If the add-in is loaded correctly, you should see a new entry in the Home tab
of the Excel ribbon called "ME Tools". Clicking on the "Basic Tools" button will 
toggle the taskpane on the right-hand side of the Excel window.

.Taskpane
image::excel-with-taskpane.png[]

The taskpane provides access to the various tools and functionalities of the add-in. 
You can select the desired tool from the menu items.

=== Analytical Performance Specifications

The Analytical Performance Specifications (APS) section allows you to set and manage performance 
specifications for your laboratory method. You can define specifications based on 
clinical requirements, biological variation, or other criteria.

.Setting Performance Specifications
image::aps-entry.png[align="center"]

The specifications can be entered directly into the taskpane or imported from the Excel 
worksheet.

The APS are assumed to be total allowable error (TEa) specifications. "APS Absolute"
should be entered as absolute values. "APS Relative" should be entered as a relative
fraction (e.g. 0.1 for 10%).

=== Analysing Method Comparisons

.Method Comparison Tools
image::regression-tool.png[float="right"]

The Regression tool allows you to perform various types of regression analysis on your 
method comparison data. You can select the type of regression analysis you want to 
perform from the dropdown menu. The available options are:

* Deming Regression: This method accounts for errors in both the x and y variables but assumes constant variance.
* Weighted Deming Regression: This method accounts for errors in both the x and y variables and allows for constant coefficient of variation (CV).
* Passing-Bablok Regression: This is a non-parametric method that does not assume any specific distribution of errors.

To use the Regression tool, you need to select the data range in your Excel worksheet 
that contains the method comparison data. Data may be in singlicate or duplicate. If the 
comparison experiment has been conducted with measurements in duplicate, data for the
reference method values should be in two columns. Select the cells containing the reference
method values and then click over the select icon for that field:

image::select-icon.png[]

This will copy the address of the selected range to the relevant field in the taskpane.

Repeat this process for the test method values.

The "Output Range" should be a single cell where you would like results of the regression
analysis to be saved.

Confidence intervals for the slope and intercept can be calculated using either the default 
method or bootstrap resampling. The bootstrap method is more computationally intensive but 
may provide more accurate confidence intervals, particularly for small sample sizes or non-normal data. 
The default method is based on a jackknife procedure for Deming regresssion,
while a non-parametric estimate is used for Passing-Bablok regression.

If Deming or Weighted Deming regression is selected, you will need to provide an estimate of the
ratio of the variances of the measurement errors for the two methods. If measurements have been 
made in duplicate, this can be estimated from the replicate measurements. If not, you will need to 
provide an estimate based on prior knowledge, literature values, or make an assumption that
both methods have similar variance and use a value of 1.0.

The "Bland Altman Range" is the region over which the difference plot will be charted in Excel.
Suppose the range is set as H15:P30, the top left of the chart will be at H15 and the bottom 
right will be at P30. The range should be large enough to accommodate the chart, which will
extend downwards and to the right from the top left cell.

Similarly the "Scatter Plot Range" is the region over which the scatter plot will be charted in 
Excel.

"Chart Data Output" is a single cell where the address of the data range used to create the 
charts will be saved. This should be a cell in a remote part of the worksheet, as the data will 
be written to the right and below the specified cell, and is required for the charts to be 
created.

Once you have selected the data ranges and set the parameters, click the "Run" button
to perform the analysis. The results will be saved to the specified output range, and 
the charts will be created at the specified chart ranges.

TIP: If you are using the method verification workbook, you can automatically populate the
cell ranges by clicking the "Load Defaults" button. This will fill in the cell ranges
based on the default locations in the workbook.

==== Concordance

Concordance can be assessed in one of two ways. The first relates to analytical methods that 
produce quantitative results. Under these circumstances, the 
diagnostic concordance between two methods that are being compared is assessed by setting the
diagnostic thresholds to define the result categories for each method and then 
using those to calculate a Cohen's Kappa statistic.

The number of diagostic thresholds for the two methods must be the same although the 
thresholds themselves may be different for the two methods. For example a reference
assay may be regarded as reactive if a result is >= 50; not reactive if a result is < 25 
and equivocal for values between 25 and 50. Where as the assay being compared may have 
thresholds of 32 and 64 respectively for the same diagnostic outcome.

Again, it is necessary to select the top left cell in the worksheet where the contingency table
and resultant statistics will be saved.

The second way is for laboratory methods that produce qualitative or ordinal results. These
are analysed in a separate section for Qualitative Comparisons. The comparison data must be
listed in two columns and use the same labels.

.Arrangement of Qualitative Data
[options="header", width=30%]
|===
| Method A | Method B
| Positive | Positive
| Positive | Equivocal
| Positive | Negative
| Equivocal | Positive
| Equivocal | Equivocal
| Equivocal | Negative
| Negative | Positive
| Negative | Negative

=== Analysing Imprecision

Imprecision is assessed using the procedures described in CLSI EP05 and CLSI EP15, with a
one way or two way analysis of variance. It assumes replicate analysis has been performed
in one or more runs per day over a number of days. 

The data needs to be arranged in "long format" where all results for a given level should
appear in a single column. There should be separate columns for the day and run, with
each row specifying both the day and the run (no blanks).
An example of the recommended layout is shown in the table below where triplicate
measurements have been made in each run with two runs per day over two days.
Verification studies will generally only involve a single run each day.

.Arrangement of Imprecision Data
[options="header", width=50%]
|===
| Day   | Run   | Level 1 | Level 2
| Day 1 | Run 1 | 1.2     | 11.3
| Day 1 | Run 1 | 1.1     | 12.2
| Day 1 | Run 1 | 1.1     | 11.3
| Day 1 | Run 2 | 1.3     | 11.9
| Day 1 | Run 2 | 1.2     | 11.3
| Day 1 | Run 2 | 1.3     | 12.2
| Day 2 | Run 1 | 1.4     | 12.1
| Day 2 | Run 1 | 1.3     | 12.0
| Day 2 | Run 1 | 1.3     | 11.5
| Day 2 | Run 2 | 1.5     | 11.8
| Day 2 | Run 2 | 1.2     | 12.3
| Day 2 | Run 2 | 1.2     | 10.4
|===

Select the column containing the days and then click over the select icon for that
field to copy the address to the form. Do the same for the column containing the runs.
Note if there is only a single run per day, this can be omitted.

Select the columns contaning the results for each level and then click on the select
icon for that field to copy the address to the form.

Select the top left cell where the results of the analysis should be saved, and copy
that address to the form.

Check for outliers using Grubb's test. Grubb's test is used to detect a single outlier 
in a univariate data set that follows an approximately normal distribution. Other tests
are recommended if you suspect more than one outlier may be present. If outliers are
found in any of the results columns these will be displayed in an alert box. The
background color of the specific cells will also be set to yellow. If an outlier is
found it should be removed prior to running the analysis. It is recommended that the
days data is excluded for that level and precision is assessed again for another day.

Click the "Run" button to perform the analysis of imprecision.

NOTE: For a verification study involving performing k replicates over i days, balanced
data is preferred but the statistical procedures will tolerate small imbalances. 
That is, days with less than the full complement of replicates. In contrast, for a 
nested design with k replicates in each of j runs over  i days, the data must be balanced
to calculate the pooled degrees of freedom used to calculate the confidence intervals.
Unbalanced data will cause the Add-in to report an error.

=== Imprecision Layout

This section provides a simple two to create a template layout for analysis of 
imprecision. It is useful where precision is assessed over more than one day
or in multiple runs.

The default layout is the standard 5 replicates over 5 days used for assessing
imprecision using the CLSI EP15 guideline.

.Default 5 x 5 layout
image::precision-layout-2.png[]

Alternative layouts can be created by specifying the number of days, runs, and
replicates; selecting the top left cell (Layout Range) for the layout
to be written; and then clicking on "Setup".

.Alternative 20 x 2 x 2 Layout
image::precision-layout-3.png[]

In the process of writing the layout to the worksheet, the cell ranges used for
specifying the days, runs, and values are copied to the Analyse Precision form.

.Copied cell ranges

=== Errors and Warnings

[discrete]
===== You cannot perform the requested operation

This error message usually arises if the add-in is attempting to write to a write
protected cell or series of cells. The easiest way of avoiding this is to 
unprotect the sheet. Protection can be reapplied once the add-in operation has
been completed.

Alternatively, if you are preparing a template, the cells that the add-in will
write to can be unlocked in advanced. First, highlight the relevant cells in 
Excel and right click to display the context menu.

image::format-cell.png[]

Choose the "Format Cells" item, which will display the Format Cells dialog.

image::unlock-cell.png[]

Select the *Protection* tab and then uncheck the *Locked" option. Select OK to 
save the changes. The worksheet protection may then be applied in the usual way
and the add-in will still be able to write to the cells.

Note, however, that charts can only be created and displayed by the add-in if 
the active worksheet is unprotected.

== Installing the Add-in

Under normal circumstances, installation and activation of an Excel Add-in is 
very easy. All that is required is to go to the Add-ins menu item on the 
Home tab (Fig 1).

.Add-ins menu item
image::addin-menu.png[]

Find the add-in from the available add-in and select Add.

.Adding an add-in
image::addin-install.png[]

At the current time, the add-in is only available in development mode,
which means it must be "side-loaded".
This is a bit more involved and requires a number of files
to be downloaded. Doing this from behind corporate firewalls
can be challenging unless you are familiar with using proxy
configurations.

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/office/dev/add-ins/[Microsoft] 
now recommend developing Office add-ins using standard
web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Excel runs
these as a web page within Excel. To sideload an application it
must be run using nodejs, which is a powerful tool for developing
server-side and client-side applications by running javascript
outside a web browser.

=== Side-loading the add-in

Follow these steps to sideload the add-in:

. Download the add-in repository from https://github.com/dche658/method-eval-tools
    a. You can do this by clicking the green "Code" button and selecting
    "Download ZIP".
    b. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a directory on your computer.
. Alternatively, if you have git installed on your computer you can clone the repository 
with the following command:
+
----
git clone https://github.com/dche658/method-eval-tools.git
----

. Download nvm-setup.exe for windows from https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases
. Install nvm-setup.exe
. Open a command prompt and run the following commands (update the version number
as needed). Note, lts just stands for long-term-support.
+
----
nvm install lts
nvm use 24.6.0
----
. Navigate to the directory where you extracted the downloaded repository 
and run:
+
----
npm install
----
+
This will take quite some time to complete as all the libraries used in 
development must be downloaded and installed. 
. Finally, execute the add-in with:
+
----
npm run start
----

A separate terminal window will open, after which Excel will be launched.
Startup can take a few minutes to complete. 

When you have finished using Excel and the add-in, do not just close the 
terminal window. You must execute the stop command so the cache is cleared.
Otherwise, problems can arise when you try to run the add-in again.
----
npm run stop
----

=== Option: Install on a Portable Device

If you do not have administrator access then you can install the add-in on a 
portable device. A high speed external solid state drive will likely give
you the best results.

Instructions for installing nodejs as a portable application have been taken
from https://dev.to/yougotwill/portable-nodejs-without-administrator-access-1elk[here].

. Install https://cmder.app/[Cmder] in your desired location on the portable drive.
. Download https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows[nvm-noinstall.zip] from the latest release.
. Extract the contents of nvm-noinstall.zip into the bin folder inside of the portable Cmder folder.
. Navigate to the bin folder in Cmder and run install.cmd
. When asked to enter the absolute path use your Cmder bin folder.
. Install the version of node you want eg. nvm install latest (Make sure to still be inside of the bin folder in your terminal program).
. Wait until node and npm have finished installing.
. Inside the bin folder there should be a folder containing the latest node version e.g. v24.6.0 at the time of writing.
. Copy the absolute path to that folder. e.g. E:\PortableApps\CmderPortable\bin\v24.6.0.
. Add this to your existing path in Cmder's environment settings. This can be done in a couple of ways. The first is by running the following command.
+
----
set "PATH=E:\PortableApps\CmderPortable\bin\v24.6.0;%PATH%"
----
. Alternatively edit the user profile e.g.  E:\PortableApps\CmderPortable\config\user_profile.cmd and add a line e.g. 'set "PATH=%CMDER_ROOT%\bin\v24.6.0;%PATH%"'
. Make sure you are still inside your bin folder. Run nvm use v24.6.0 or your chosen node version. You can close the username and password window both times without entering anything. It should tell you Now using node v24.6.0 (64-bit).
. Close and open Cmder and you should have access to node, npm and npx
. If you are behind a corporate firewall you will probably need to set the 
proxy configuration. Suggestions on how to do this a shown below.
. Download and extract the add-in repository as described above.
. Then run the following commands to install the add-in and then side-load
it into Excel.

----
npm install
npm run start
----

If you have an Excel workbook on OneDrive you can copy a link to the document
and use the following command to side-load the add-in into Excel.

----
npm run start -- web --document https://1drv.ms/x/c/7ba37898bfb7e549/EdiktLds9p5MvIFWYzL0-QBSw?e=5BUXE7
----

=== Option: Set a proxy for npm

Find the proxy settings for your network by opening Settings. Go to 
Network and Internet, and then Proxy.

If a manual proxy has been configured, you can copy those details. If a script has
been used, this is often located at https://your.domain/proxy.pac. You can generally 
see the content of the proxy.pac file by copying the url to you web browser and use
your browser to display the file. Inspect the content of the file to find the 
appropriate proxy server url and port for your subnet (often the default).

Run the following commands to set the proxy and https proxy.

----
npm config set proxy http://<username>:<password>@<proxy-server-url>:<port>
npm config set https-proxy http://<username>:<password>@<proxy-server-url>:<port>
----

Run the following command to confirm the npm settings

----
npm config list
----

In many cases if you run 'npm install' at this point you will get an untrusted 
certificate error. This often occurs because your organisation uses its own
Certificate Authority. To get around this you will need to either get root
certificate from your IT department, export it from your web browser, or run
the "Manage computer certificates" settings app and export it from there in pem format.

image::trusted-certificates.png[]

Configure cafile with the command

----
npm config set cafile /path/to/your/corporate/root/certificate.pem
----

The alternative approach is to temporarily Bypass SSL Validation.
This method disables strict SSL validation and is generally not recommended 
for long-term use due to security implications.

----
npm config set strict-ssl false
npm config set registry="http://registry.npmjs.org/"
----

where stem:[\chi^{2}] is the quantile for the chi-squared distribution at the
specified confidence level with DF2 degrees of freedom.

distribution at the specified confidence level with stem:[DF_{WL}] degrees of 
freedom.

stem:[UVL=F\times\sigma] : upper verification limit expressed as SD.

stem:[UVL=F\times%CV] : upper verification limit expressed as CV.

NOTE: The add-in produces slightly different results to Excel when calculating 
the within laboratory verification limit factor F. Investigations suggest this 
occurs because the CHISQ.INV function in Excel rounds the degrees of freedom to
an integer value. In contrast, the equivalent function in the jStat library
used by this application is able to calculate the result with decimal values.

Let stem:[p_{ij}] be the proportion of subjects placed in the __i,j__th cell, where the proportion is
simply calculated as the tabulated value divided by the grand total. Let

stem:[p_{i.}=\sum_{j=1}^{k}p_{ij}]

the proportion of subject placed in the __i__th row, and let

stem:[p_{.j}=\sum_{i=1}^{k}p_{ij}]

the proportion of subjects placed in the __j__th column.

The observed agreement is given by:

Kappa is defined as:

stem:[\kappa=\frac{p_{o}-p_{e}}{1-p_{e}}]


The estimated sample variance is given by:

stem:[Var(\kappa)=\frac{1}{N(1-p_{e})^{4}}\{(\sum_{i=1}^{k}p_{ii}\times((1-p_{e})-(p_{.i}+p_{i.})(1-p_{o}))^{2}) + (1-p_{o})^{2}\sum_{i=1}^{k}\sum_{j=1}^{k}p_{ij}(p_{.i}+p_{j.})^{2}-(p_{o}p_{e}-2p_{e}+p_{o})^{2}\}]

therefore the estimated standard error is:

stem:[SE(\kappa)=\frac{\sqrt{Var(\kappa)}}{\sqrt{N}}=\frac{1}{(1-p_{e})^{2}}\sqrt{\{(\sum_{i=1}^{k}p_{ii}\times((1-p_{e})-(p_{.i}+p_{i.})(1-p_{o}))^{2}) + (1-p_{o})^{2}\sum_{i=1}^{k}\sum_{j=1}^{k}p_{ij}(p_{.i}+p_{j.})^{2}-(p_{o}p_{e}-2p_{e}+p_{o})^{2}\}}]

The confidence intervals are then calculated as

stem:[\kappa \pm z_{\alpha/2}SE(\kappa)]

==== Grubb's Test for Outliers

In NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods , 16/10/2025.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grubbs%27s_test


H~0~:	There are no outliers in the data set +
H~a~:	There is exactly one outlier in the data set

Test Statistic:	The Grubbs' test statistic is defined as:

stem:[G=\frac{max|Y_{i} - \bar{Y}|}{s}]

where stem:[\bar{Y}] and s are the mean and sample standard deviation respectively.

This is the two-sided test, for which the hypothesis of no outliers is rejected at significance level α if

stem:[G > \frac{N - 1}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{\frac{(t_{\alpha/(2N),N-2})^{2}}{N - 2 + (t_{\alpha/(2N),N-2})^{2}}]
